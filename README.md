# Image search

## First task
* Make the image search application,
* register to unsplash, it is free. Documentation: https://unsplash.com/documentation,
* don't use any dependency (no build tools, no frameworks, no libraries),
* for http requests use `XMLHttpRequest` (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest),
* structure you code as you wish.
* style your html as you like.

* Do not follow my implementation. It is unstructured on purpose :),

## First task followup
* check the structure, best practices, clean code stuff if needed.

## Second task
* coming soon... (something with promises)

## Third task
* coming soon... (something with fetch or jQuery deferred TBD)

## Fourth task
* (optional) rewrite with a framework
